# Algorithms And Data Structures

1. Find Median from Data Stream: implemented a min-heap and a max-heap to store larger and smaller halves of the data stream respectively

2. Trie (Prefix Tree)

3. Segment Tree: sum the elements of integer array nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

4. Kosaraju's Two-Pass DFS Algorithm for computing Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graph.

5. min-heap for storing graph edges

6. Dijkstra's Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm (O(mn) time complexity, m: number of edges, n: number of nodes).

7. Dijkstra's Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm using min-heap to store Dijkstra's greedy score for each node (O(mlogn) time complexity).

8. Sequence Alignment using Dynamic Programming (O(mn) time complexity, m: length of first sequence, n: length of second sequence).

9. BellmanFord's Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm that allows negative edge length (Dynamic Programming: O(mn) time complexity).

10. FloyedWarshall's All-Pairs Shortest Paths Algorithm that allows negative edge length (Dynamic Programming: O(n*n*n) time complexity).
